# Headphone-dB-Meter

A decibel meter that knows how loud you're listening to music on your Apple EarPods. It can automatically reduce the volume if the dB level exceeds the set limit.

Protect your hearing!

# NOTE:

The meter was tested on HP 15t-dy100 and Apple EarPods only. Accuracy may not be guaranteed on other headphones/earbuds or devices.

VB Hi-Fi Cable: https://download.vb-audio.com/Download_CABLE/HiFiCableAsioBridgeSetup_v1007.zip

The VB Hi-Fi Cable must be installed along with a split audio output program (eg OBS+Audio Monitor).

OBS (with necessary plugins): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1II3nyKbAy5YOEfShlgLsGeU040QMhkKW/view?usp=sharing

To use the included OBS + Audio Monitor for splitting:

DO NOT UPDATE OBS.
Desktop Audio Settings Cog > Filters... > Audio Monitor.
Name can be anything you want.
On the newly created filter, select the VB Cable as your monitor output.
Launch the app. Then, go to Windows Settings then System > Sound > Volume mixer > Headphone Levels (expand) then select Hi-Fi Cable Output as the input device for that app. Relaunch the app for the settings to take effect.

Ignore any antivirus warnings, as my program is recently released, which can cause antiviruses to give a warning or even remove the file.

The audio splitting program must be running for the program to work.
